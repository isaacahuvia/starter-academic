abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is imposing uneven economic and health burdens
  on different communities in Illinois. Until a vaccine or effective therapy is
  available, intensive testing and monitoring of the disease will be necessary
  to prevent community spread and facilitate economic reopening. Unfortunately,
  existing inequities are likely to inhibit these efforts by creating barriers
  to accessing healthcare. An analysis by researchers at the University of
  Chicago Poverty Lab suggests that communities with high shares of residents
  without health insurance and residents who are undocumented face additional
  barriers to testing and care.1 Other community-level characteristics including
  racial composition, household size, density of essential workers and
  population density, do not appear to be significant predictors of test
  positivity rates. Expanding testing sites alone will likely be insufficient to
  address these disparities, and policymakers should pursue a holistic approach
  in partnership with affected communities. Finally, it is important to note
  that this analysis does not speak to the differential mortality risk
  associated with COVID-19 in different communities. This is a critical issue
  that is beyond the scope of the current report.
