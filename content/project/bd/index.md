title: "Body Dissatisfaction and Depression"
summary: "Body dissatisfaction is a significant contributor to depression among adolescents. It is particularly common among adolescent girls, who are at particular risk for depression. Despite this, no study has systematically examined the effect of body dissatisfaction interventions on depression outcomes. Working with Dr. Jessica Schleider and the Lab for Scalable Mental Health, Isaac is working to quantify the effects of such interventions on depression in adolescents. Ultimately, we hope to understand the potential of targeting body dissatisfaction to prevent depression in adolescence and to combat the gender gap that emerges in this period."
